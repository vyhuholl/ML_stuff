Miscellaneous Jupyter notebooks.

* [`confidence_intervals.ipynb`](https://github.com/vyhuholl/ML_stuff/blob/master/confidence_intervals.ipynb) – a notebook illustrating different approaches to constructing **confidence intervals**, as shown on the [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris) and a [decision tree classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html);
* [`confidence_intervals_experiment.py`](https://github.com/vyhuholl/ML_stuff/blob/master/confidence_intervals_experiment.py) – a Python script to test a confidence interval on a synthetic dataset, repeating many times with different random seeds for dataset generation;
* [`deepdream.ipynb`](https://github.com/vyhuholl/ML_stuff/blob/master/deepdream.ipynb) – some experiments with the DeepDream technology (visialization of the patterns a neural network "sees" in an image);
* [`supervised_clustering.ipynb`](https://github.com/vyhuholl/ML_stuff/blob/master/supervised_clustering.ipynb) – a notebook illustrating [supervised clustering with SHAP values](https://www.aidancooper.co.uk/supervised-clustering-shap-values/?utm_campaign=Data_Elixir&utm_source=Data_Elixir_387).
